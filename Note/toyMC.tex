\section{Scope and Motivation}
\label{sec:toyMC}

In this section, we discuss the vital importance of waveform analysis for incident light measurements in PMT-based experiments.

Like figure~\ref{fig:detector}, a typical neutrino or dark matter detector has a large-volumed target medium surrounded by an array of PMTs. In an \textit{event}, a particle interacts with the target medium and deposits energy when passing through the detector. Part of such energy converts into visible Cherenkov or scintillation photons. A photon propagates to the boundary of the detector and converts into a PE by about \SIrange{20}{30}{\percent} quantum efficiency if it hits a PMT.

  \caption{\subref{fig:detector} The target volume maybe of cylinder or polyhedra shapes.  The PMTs' size varies from several to tens of \si{cm}.  The target medium could be pure water or ice, organic or inorganic scintillators. The principle of PMT photon counting remains the same. \subref{fig:time-pro} A scintillator paired with ultra-fast photo-sensors gives the green curve with $\tau_\ell \gg \sigma_\ell$.  A fast Cherenkov detector by the red curve has $\tau_\ell \ll \sigma_\ell$.  The blue curve combining $\tau_\ell=\SI{20}{ns}$ and $\sigma_\ell=\SI{5}{ns}$ represents a typical scintillation detector.  We can regard $\phi(t)\mathrm{d}t$ as a probability density function~(PDF at the vertical axis) of PE times.}
\end{figure}

The larger the detector, the smaller the solid angle each PMT covers.  The light intensity seen by a PMT can be extremely low.  A PMT works in \textit{photon counting} or \textit{digital mode}, where it is viable to count individual PEs.  \textit{Analog mode} is the opposite, where there are so many PE pulses overlapping that the output is a continuous electric current.  Even in one event of the same detector, PMTs can operate in different modes, depending on the proximity of them to the event vertex.  A unified waveform algorithm should handle both extremes, and the intermediate ``overlap, but distinguishable'' mode with an example in figure~\ref{fig:pile}.  In this study,  we cover most of the cases with PE occupancy from 0.5 to 30.

The PE, waveform and their estimators are hierarchical and intercorelated.  We explicitly summarize the symbol conventions of this article in table~\ref{tab:symbol}.

\subsection{Light curve}
\label{sec:lc}
The \textit{light curve} is the time evolution of light intensity illuminating a PMT,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:light-curve}
  \mu\phi(t-t_0)
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the intensity factor, $t_0$ is the time shift factor, and $\phi(\cdot)$ is the normalized shape function. For simplicity, we parameterize the scintillation light curve as an exponential distribution and the Cherenkov one by a Dirac delta function.  It is convenient to model the PMT transit time spread~(TTS) in $\phi(t)$ as a Gaussian smear, giving an \textit{ex-Gaussian} or \textit{exponentially modified Gaussian}~\cite{li_separation_2016},
\begin{align}
    \phi(t) = \frac{1}{2\tau_\ell} \exp\left(\frac{\sigma_\ell^2}{2\tau_\ell^2}-\frac{t}{\tau_\ell}\right) \left[1 - \erf\left( \frac{\sigma_\ell}{\sqrt{2}\tau_\ell} - \frac{t}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_\ell} \right)\right],
    \label{eq:time-pro}
\end{align}
where subscript $\ell$ stands for ``light curve'' and $\sigma_\ell$ encodes the timing uncertainty mainly from TTS. $\phi(t)$ of Cherenkov light is a pure Gaussian by taking $\tau_\ell \rightarrow 0$. Figure~\ref{fig:time-pro} illustrates 3 examples of $\phi(t)$. 

\subsection{Single electron response}
\label{subsec:spe}

A PE induced by a photon at the PMT photocathode is accelerated, collected, and amplified by several stages into $\num[retain-unity-mantissa=false]{\sim 1e7}$ electrons, forming a voltage pulse $V_\mathrm{PE}(t)$ in the PMT output.  Wright~et~al.~\cite{wright_low_1954} formulated the cascade multiplication of secondary electrons assuming the amplification of each stage following Poisson distribution.  Breitenberger~\cite{breitenberger_scintillation_1955} compared the statistical model with a summary of laboratory measurements observing the gain variance to be larger than predicted. Percott~\cite{prescott_statistical_1966} used Polya distribution to account for extra variance of Poisson rate non-uniformity.  With modern high gain PMTs ($\num[retain-unity-mantissa=false]{\sim 1e7}$), Caldwell et al.~\cite{caldwell_characterization_2013} from MiniCLEAN and Amaudruz et al.~\cite{amaudruz_-situ_2019} from DEAP-3600 suggested gamma distribution as the continuous counterpart of the Polya.  Neves et al.~\cite{neves_calibration_2010} from ZEPLIN-III did a survey of the literature but prefer to model the gain in a data-driven way by calibration, without assuming any well-known probability distributions.  We choose gamma distribution in this work over Gaussian because the amplification is always positive.

A sample of PEs from the light curve $\phi(t)$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:time-pro} can be formulated as several delta functions, also known as sparse spike train~\cite{levy_reconstruction_1981}, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lc-sample}
  \tilde{\phi}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{PE}}} q_i \delta(t-t_i),
\end{equation}
where $N_\mathrm{PE}$ is the number of PEs following Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu$.  $t_i$ is the hit time of the $i$-th PE, $q_i$ is the relative charge of the $i$-th PE from gamma distribution.  We set the shape ($k=1/0.4^2$) and scale ($\theta=0.4^2$) parameters of gamma so that $\E[q_i] = 1$ and $\Var[q_i] = 0.4^2$, corresponding to a typical first-stage amplification of 7--8\footnote{For large gain and Poisson-distributed first-stage amplicication $M_1$, $\Var[q_i] \approx \frac{1}{M_1-1}$.}.

Birks~\cite{birks_theory_1967} summarized laboratory measurements of single-electron-response~(SER) pulse shape and indicated a crude assumption of Gaussian shape is adequate, but also mentioned asymmetric model of $t e^{-bt}$ having a faster rise than decay by Hamilton and Wright~\cite{hamilton_transit_1956}.  To better model the rising edge curvature than Hamilton and Wright, S.~Jetter~et al.~\cite{jetter_pmt_2012} from DayaBay used log-normal as a convenient phenomenological representation of the SER pulse.  As in figure~\ref{fig:spe}, the smooth rising curve of log-normal fits measurements better and the falling component captures the exponential decay characteristics of RC circuit in the electronics readout.  Caldwell~et~al.~\cite{caldwell_characterization_2013}, Caravaca et al.~\cite{caravaca_experiment_2017} from CHESS and Kaptanoglu~\cite{kaptanoglu_characterization_2018} used the same parameterization and found reasonable match with experimental data.  A better model embracing underlying physics mechanism may be developed in the future, but for this waveform analysis study, we adopt the log-normal SER pulse as eq.~\eqref{eq:dayaspe} without loss of generality.
\begin{equation}
  V_\mathrm{PE}(t) = V_{0}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\log(t/\tau_\mathrm{PE})}{\sigma_\mathrm{PE}}\right)^{2}\right],
  \label{eq:dayaspe}
\end{equation}
where shape parameters $\tau_\mathrm{PE}=\SI{8}{ns}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{PE}=\SI{0.5}{ns}$ and $V_{0}=\SI{14.08}{mV}$, see figure~\ref{fig:spe}.

\end{figure}

A noise-free waveform $\tilde{w}(t)$ is a convolution of $\tilde{\phi}(t)$ and $V_\mathrm{PE}(t)$, and the PMT voltage output waveform $w(t)$ is a time series modeled by the sum of $\tilde{w}(t)$ and a Gaussian white noise $\epsilon(t)$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{w}(t) &= \tilde{\phi}(t) \otimes V_\mathrm{PE}(t) \\
    w(t) &= \tilde{w}(t) + \epsilon(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} q_i V_\mathrm{PE}(t-t_i) + \epsilon(t).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
See figure~\ref{fig:pile} for an example.

We do not dive into pedestals or saturation for simplicity.  We also assume the SER pulse $V_\mathrm{PE}(t)$, the variance of charge $\Var[q_i]$ and the distribution of noise $\epsilon(t)$ are known.  Otherwise, they should be measured by PMT calibrations and modeled with uncertainty.


\subsection{Measurement of incident light}
\label{sec:time}
We see in figure~\ref{fig:pile} that pile-ups and noises hinder the time $t_i$ and charge $q_i$ of the PEs. Fortunately, event reconstruction only takes the time shift $t_0$ and the intensity $\mu$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:light-curve} as inputs, where $t_0$ carries the time of flight information and $\mu$ is the expected $N_\mathrm{PE}$ in a real detector. The former directly translate into position resolution by multiplying speed-of-light, while the latter dominates energy resolution.  All the uncertainties of $\hat{t}_i$, $\hat{q}_i$ and $\hat{N}_\mathrm{PE}$ are reflected in $\hat{t}_0$ and $\hat{\mu}$. Classical TDC extracts the waveform's threshold crossing time $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$ to approximate the hit time of the first PE, while QDC extracts total charge $Q$ from waveform integration to estimate $\mu$ by $\hat{\mu}_Q$.

\subsubsection{Time $t_0$}
\label{sec:time-shift-t_0}

$\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$ is a biased estimator of $t_0$.  It is affected by the light intensity $\mu$, which we shall show in figure~\ref{fig:biasmethods} and section~\ref{subsec:timeresolution}. We define the resolution $\sigma_\mathrm{1st}$ for a batch of waveforms as the standard deviation of $\Delta t_0 = \hat{t}_\mathrm{1st} - t_0$. From a hypothetical perfect measurement of $t_i$, we define an ideal maximum likelihood estimator~(MLE) $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ to capture time information of all the PEs,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL} = \arg\underset{t_0}{\max} \prod_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} \phi(t_i-t_0).
\end{equation}
The corresponding $\sigma_\mathrm{ALL}$ is the lower bound of time resolution. 

To characterize $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$ and $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$, we scan $\mu$ from \numrange{0}{30} for each light curve in figure~\ref{fig:time-pro}. We generate a sample of $\num[retain-unity-mantissa=false]{1e4}$ waveforms having at least 1 PE for every triplet of $(\tau_\ell, \sigma_\ell, \mu)$.  Figure~\ref{fig:reso-diff} shows that $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}}$ equals $\sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$ when $\tau_\ell \gg \sigma_\ell$, because $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ reduces to $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$(=$\min_i t_i$) for an exponential light curve. For $\mu \to 0$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$ are also equal because at most 1 PE is available.  TDC is effective in those cases.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{1.0\textwidth}{!}{\input{figures/vs-deltadiv.pgf}}
  \caption{\label{fig:reso-diff} Time resolution comparisons between $\hat{t}_{\mathrm{ALL}}$~(solid lines, when using the information of all PEs) and $\hat{t}_\mathrm{1st}$~(dashed lines, using the first PE instead of the threshold crossing time to eliminate the influence from TDC).  The difference is manifested especially when $\sigma_\ell$ and $\mu$ are large. The three cases of $(\tau_\ell, \sigma_\ell)/\si{ns}$ represent the scintillation with ultra-fast PMTs~$(20, 0)$, Cherenkov~$(0, 5)$ and scintillation coupled with PMT TTS~$(20, 5)$. The performance of waveform analysis lies between $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$. }
\end{figure}

Nevertheless, for $\sigma_\ell > 0$ and $\mu >0$, the $\sigma_{\mathrm{1st}}$ significantly deteriorates from $\sigma_{\mathrm{ALL}}$.  For Cherenkov and scintillation experiments with non-negligible PMT TTS and occupancy, we shall explore more sophisticated waveform analysis algorithms to go beyond $\hat{t}_{\mathrm{1st}}$ and recover the accuracy of $\hat{t}_\mathrm{ALL}$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:2} from waveform in eq.~\eqref{eq:1}.

\subsubsection{Intensity $\mu$}
\label{sec:intensity-mu}

Noting $Q_0 = {\int V_\mathrm{PE}(t) \mathrm{d} t}$, the charge estimator $\hat{\mu}_Q$ for QDC is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \label{eq:mu-q}
  \hat{\mu}_Q = \frac{1}{Q_0}\int w(t) \mathrm{d} t &= \frac{1}{Q_0}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} \int \left[ q_i V_\mathrm{PE}(t-t_i) + \epsilon(t) \right] \mathrm{d} t \\
  & = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} q_i + \frac{1}{Q_0} \int \epsilon(t) \mathrm{d} t.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Its expectation and variance are,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy}
  \begin{aligned}
    \E[\hat{\mu}_Q] &= \E[N_\mathrm{PE}] \\
    \Var[\hat{\mu}_Q] &= \Var\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{PE}} q_i\right] + \Var\left[\frac{1}{Q_0} \int \epsilon(t) \mathrm{d} t\right] \\
    &= \E[q^2] \Var(N_\mathrm{PE}) + \frac{T}{Q_0^2} \sigma_\epsilon^2 \\
    &= (1 + \sigma_\mathrm{q}^2) \Var(N_\mathrm{PE}) + \frac{T}{Q_0^2} \sigma_\epsilon^2. \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the first term of the variance is the that of a compound Poisson distribution with a Gaussian jump, and $T$ in the second one is a constant proportional to the time window.  Resolution of $\hat{\mu}_Q$ is affected by the Poisson fluctuation of $N_\mathrm{PE}$, the charge resolution of a PE $\sigma_\mathrm{q}$ and the while noise $\sigma_\epsilon$.

Sometimes we mitigate the impact of $\sigma_\mathrm{q}$ and $\sigma_\epsilon$ by rounding $\hat{\mu}_Q$ to integers.  It works well for $N_\mathrm{PE} \le 1$, which is equivalently a hit-based 0-1 $\mu$ estimator $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{hit}$.  But for $N_\mathrm{PE} \ge 2$, it is hard to interpret $\hat{\mu}_Q$ rounding by physics principles and $\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{hit}$ does not gain any additional information from the extra PEs.

The goal of waveform analysis is to eliminate the impact of $\sigma_\mathrm{q}$ and $\sigma_\epsilon$ as much as possible.  The pure Poisson fluctuation of $N_\mathrm{PE}$ is the resolution lower bound $\underline{\sigma}_\mu = \sqrt{\mu}$ of any $\mu$ estimator.

\subsubsection{Shape $\phi(\cdot)$}
\label{sec:shape-phicdot}

The shape of a light curve is determined by light emission time profile, PMT timing and light propagation, including refraction, reflection, dispersion and scattering.  $\phi(\cdot)$ thus depends on event locations.  In this article, we model $\phi(\cdot)$ by eq.~\eqref{eq:time-pro} for simplicity and leave the $\phi(\cdot)$ variations to event reconstruction in future publications.

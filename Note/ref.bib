	abstract = {A gateless charge integrator designed for the energy measurement in the Borexino experiment is described and the results of various tests performed on prototypes are shown. The circuit integrates always its input taking advantage of the AC coupling to the photomultipliers that equalizes to zero the charge associated with each event signal. A double sampling of the integrator output allows to perform a charge measurement in principle without dead time, avoiding the use of gate signals and baseline restoration networks and permitting a precise detection of the fast correlated events (delayed coincidences due to the decay of a nuclide producing a daughter having a lifetime in the tens of ns time range). The precision of the charge measurement is discussed together with the performances of the front end Borexino board where the integrator is mounted.},

For liquid scintillator calorimetry, the most critical requirement to waveform reconstruction is linearity. Several common reconstruction methods were tested but the linearity performance was not satisfactory. A new method based on the deconvolution technique was developed with 1\% residual non-linearity, which fulfills the requirement. The performance was validated with both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and 1\% consistency between them has been achieved.},

Data from the Kamioka liquid-scintillator antineutrino detector (KamLAND) provides valuable information for better understanding these backgrounds, especially in liquid scintillators, and for checking estimates from current simulations based upon MUSIC, FLUKA, and GEANT4. Using the time correlation between detected muons and neutron captures, the neutron production yield in the KamLAND liquid scintillator is measured to be \$(2.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} g{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$.

	abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

It is also capable of observing neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including supernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as nucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants at 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4 sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino spectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six oscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1{\textbackslash}\%. Neutrino burst from a typical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to {\textasciitilde}5000 inverse-beta-decay events and {\textasciitilde}2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic scattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information on the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino energy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of {\textasciitilde}400 events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino samples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton decay via the \$p{\textbackslash}to K{\textasciicircum}++{\textbackslash}bar{\textbackslash}nu\$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide a unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and astrophysics.

	abstract = {JUNO is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment currently under construction in Jiangmen, China. It is primary aiming to determine the neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, its 20 kt target mass makes it an ideal detector to study neutrinos from various sources, including nuclear reactors, the Earth and its atmosphere, the Sun, and even supernovae. Due to the small cross section of neutrino interactions, the event rate of neutrino experiments is limited. In order to maximize the signal-to noise ratio, it is extremely important to control the background levels. In this paper we discuss the potential of particle identification in a large liquid scintillator detector like JUNO. We discuss the underlying principles of particle identification and its application in the experiment. In order to investigate the potential of event discrimination, several event pairings are analysed, i.e. alpha/beta?, e/p?, e+/e-, and e/gamma. We compare the discrimination performance of advanced analytical techniques based on neural networks and on the topological event reconstruction keeping the standard Gatti filter as a reference. We use the Monte Carlo samples generated in the physically motivated energy intervals. We study the dependence of our cuts on energy, radial position, PMT time resolution, and dark noise. The results show an excellent performance for alpha/beta? and e/p? with the Gatti method and the neural network. Furthermore, e+/e- and e/gamma can partly be distinguished by means of neural network and topological reconstruction on a statistical basis. Especially in the latter case, the topological method proved very successful.},

Emphasis is given to the case of a sparse parameter vector and fewer observations than unknown parameters. A Gaussian mixture is chosen as the prior on the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm returns both a set of high posterior probability models and an approximate MMSE estimate of the parameter vector. Exact ratios of posterior probabilities serve to reveal potential ambiguity among multiple candidate solutions that are ambiguous due to observation noise or correlation among columns in the regressor matrix. Algorithm complexity is O(M N K), with M observations, N coefﬁcients, and K nonzero coefﬁcients. For the case that hyperparameters are unknown, an approximate maximum likelihood estimator is proposed based on the generalized expectation-maximization algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate estimation performance and illustrate the distinctions between MMSE estimation and maximum a posteriori probability model selection.},

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We develop and compare a collection of waveform analysis methods.  We show for $N_\mathrm{PE} > 1$, better time resolution can be achieved than the first PE hit time.  FSMP gives the best accuracy in both time and intensity measurements, while CNN, Fitting and LucyDDM follow.  We find significant time~($\times 2$) and intensity~($\times 1.08$) resolution improvements at higher and lower light intensities, respectively.    FSMP opens the opportunity to boost energy resolution~($\times 1.08$) and particle identification in PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.  We invite practitioners to deploy FSMP for the best use of the data and tune it for faster execution.

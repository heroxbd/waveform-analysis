\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We develop and compare a collection of waveform analysis methods.  FSMP gives the best accuracy in both time and intensity, while CNN, Fitting and LucyDDM follow.  We find significant time~($\times 2$) and intensity~($\times 1.4$) resolution improvements at higher and lower light intensities, respectively.  It opens the opportunity to boost energy resolution and particle identification in PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.  We invite practitioners to deploy FSMP for the best use of the data and tune it for faster execution.

Photomultiplier tube~(PMT) voltage waveforms are the raw data of many neutrino and dark matter experiments. Waveform analysis is the first critical step of data processing. We evaluate the performance of waveform analyses an find fast stochastic matching pursuit the best.  Direct demodulation and convolutional neural networks are also promising.  Significant time~(up to $\times 2$) and energy~(up to $\times 1.4$) resolution boosts are attainable with fast stochastic matching pursuit, which forms the cornerstones of data analysis at all PMT-based neutrino and dark matter experiments.
